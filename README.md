# CoviProtec

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic back in March 2020. Since then, the virus has been spreading at an unprecedented rate and has already claimed more than 2.5 million lives globally. 


This project is to provide a convenient way to book vaccines online and also enable hospitals to become vaccinating centre.


Features on the people side : We allow them to register for a vaccine. We also provide a choice of registering for an additional member. They can individually schedule an appointment or they can opt for 'Combined Booking'. People can select the hospitals/vaccination centre of their convenience depending on the vaccine (covaxin and covishield) and its availability. People are advised to take both the doses through our site. Initially for registered people, bookings will be open only for dose 1. 30 days after dose 1, bookings for dose 2 will be enabled. People will not be able to directly book for dose 2. People can also cancel their appointment until a day before their scheduled appointment. They can also view the FAQs related to covid.

Features on the Hospital side : They can register to become legally entitled to provide vaccinations to the patients. They can also update stock available each time a new stock arrives. They can view the total number of covaxin and covishield available. They can also set the number of vaccinations possible per day according to their convenience. They can view the people who have scheduled an appointment for vaccine at their place on a given date.
